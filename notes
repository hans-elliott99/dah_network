CUGH March 2024:
- tried to pursue some kind of network analysis, hard to do with compiled DAH data because it is essentially censored/over-aggregated.  
- ended up making some basic models for visual presentation.  
- shoud look again at STRAND package and models: see paper "Modelling animal network data in R using STRAND"
